# My educational practical work

## Description of work
Used to create tables using the **&lt;table&gt;** tag.

To create the table I used the following tags:
* The names of the tables were designed using **&lt;caption&gt;**
* Table rows created using **&lt;tr&gt;**
* Table headers were created using **&lt;th&gt;**
* Table cells were created using **&lt;td&gt;**
* When you hover over each element, a pop-up window appears with the full name of the element (**title** attribute).
* Cell sizes are specified by the **colspan** and **rowspan** attributes
* The colors and sizes of cells and tables are specified by classes
